# B - Short Sort

There are three cards with letters $a$, $b$, $c$ placed in a row in some order. You can do the following operation **at most once**:

- Pick two cards, and swap them.

Is it possible that the row becomes $abc$ after the operation? Output "`YES`" if it is possible, and "`NO`" otherwise.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 6$) â€” the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of each of the three characters $a$, $b$ and $c$ exactly once, representing the cards.

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" if you can make the row $abc$ with at most one operation, or "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`" and "`YES`" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## Sample 1

</table>

## Note

In the first test case, we don't need to do any operations, since the row is already $abc$.

In the second test case, we can swap $c$ and $b$: $acb \to abc$.

In the third test case, we can swap $b$ and $a$: $bac \to abc$.

In the fourth test case, it is impossible to make $abc$ using at most one operation.
